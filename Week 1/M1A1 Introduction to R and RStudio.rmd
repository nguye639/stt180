# Introduction

Today you will get familiar with the R/RStudio environment, specifically 
working in the Console window. The Console window will display executed code
output and can also be used for quick code execution. However, any work done
in the Console window will be lost once you exit RStudio.

# Console computation

The console can be used as a calculator. 

- addition: `+`
- subtraction: `-`
- division: `/`
- multiplication: `*`
- modulus: `%%`
- integer division: `%/%`
- raise to power: `^`

**Evaluate the following expressions in the Console window**

1. `3 + 4 * 0 - (100 / 3)`
2. `(4 + 6) * (2 ^ 6)`
3. `1 / 0`
4. `10 ^ 10 ^ 10 ^ 10`
5. `0 / 0`
6. `0.0000003 * 2`

When you launch R/RStudio numerous functions are immediately available to you. 
These include many of the mathematical and statistical operations you know.

R function | Purpose
---------- | ---------
`abs` | absolute value
`sin` | sine
`cos` | cosine
`tan` | tangent
`log` | logarithm
`exp` | exponential
`mean`| arithmetic mean
`median`| median
`sd` | standard deviation

**Evaluate the following expressions in the Console window.**

7. `abs(7)`
8. `sin(3.1415)`
9. `exp(1)`
10. `logarithm of 1, 6, 10`

What logarithm did you just take? Was it the natural log, base 10, base 2? 
**Type `?log` in the console.** A question mark that precedes a function's name or built in data object will open the help. (Note: do not put `?log` in he .rmd file, try it in the console window).

**Type the following in the Console window.**

11. `?sd`
12. `?mtcars`
13. `?longley`

**What are `mtcars` and `longley`?**

The most important aspects of R's help resource will be the description and
examples given. Examples are always at the end of the help reference. 
**How many examples are given in the help of `sd`?**

14. Run the example provided in the help for `sd`.

**Investigate what the following functions do:**

15. `sqrt`
16. `round`
17. `floor`
18. `ceiling`

# Longley data

## Examine the data

Consider Longley's Economic Regression Data. This data set is built-in to R.
That means it is available immediately once RStudio is launched.
Type `longley` in your console to see the entire data set. The same data is
given below.

```{r echo=FALSE}
longley
```

**Answer the following questions about the `longley` data set.**

1. How many rows and columns does `longley` have?

```{r}

nrow(longley)
ncol(longley)
```

2. What is the difference between the first column of years and the column
   with the label Year?

**Type `head(longley)` in the Console window. What does this do?** 
**How about `tail(longley)`?**

## Summary statistics

The data set `longley` is stored in R as a data frame. Each column is a
vector of the same variable type. We will learn about these details later.
For now, to access a specific vector use `longley$variable_name`, where
`variable_name` is one of the variables in `longley`. For example,

```{r}
longley$GNP
```

```{r}
longley$Year
```

give the GNP and Year vectors of data.

**In your Console window get the following vectors:**

3. Unemployed
4. Population
5. Employed

**In your Console window compute the mean, median, and standard deviation for**
**each of the vectors in 3 - 5.** You can press the up-arrow on your keyboard
to cycle through previous inputs in the Console.

**Compute the maximum and minimum for each of the vectors in 3 - 5**.

The `summary` function in R will give you many of these statistics. For example,

```{r}
summary(longley$GNP)
```
gives us the minimum, maximum, mean, and quartiles of the GNP vector of data.

**Use the `summary` function on two variables of your choice in `longley`.**
**Do you think it makes sense to use the `summary` function on the variable**
**Year in `longley`?**

## Employment investigation

Suppose it is 1962. Two economists are discussing employment. Each makes the following claim.

**Economist A:** Employment has never been higher in the past 15 years, we have seen a gradual increase from 1947 to 1962.

**Economist B:** Employment has been range bound since 1947 and is at its lowest level since 1947.

**Which economist is correct?**

To make a simple plot use the function `plot`. Let's look at the variable
Employed across time.

```{r fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
plot(x = longley$Year, y = longley$Employed)
```

**Is this the best way to look at employment over time?**
**Discuss this with those in your team.**
**Think of and create a more meaningful representation of employment**
**and plot it.**

**Which economist is correct?**

The graphic doesn't look as nice as the election plots we examined last time.
The `plot` function is part of the base R graphics. The plots used last time
were constructed from function in the `ggplot2` package. 
We will use the package extensively in the
future. However, we can tidy the above plot with the following code.

```{r fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
plot(x = longley$Year, y = longley$Employed, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Employed")
```

**Tidy up the plot you created by adding labels. Feel free to add colors or**
**other features.**

An example of advanced graphics:

Later we will learn about more advanced graphics, such as the one below. 
Place your cursor on each point to see that year's GNP.

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(rvg)
library(ggiraph)

longley$tooltip <- paste("GNP: ", longley$GNP, sep = "")

gg_point_1 <- ggplot(longley, 
                     aes(x = Year, y = Employed, tooltip = tooltip)) + 
              geom_point_interactive(size = 4, color = "darkblue") + 
              theme_bw()

ggiraph(ggobj = gg_point_1)
```
