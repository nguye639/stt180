# Introduction

The `Lahman` package in R contains a plethora of baseball data. The package 
is used extensively in the book, *Analyzing Baseball Data with R*, by Max Marchi
and Jim Albert (2013). This assignment will use a subset of data from the 
`Lahman` package to expose you to some basic descriptive statistical functions
and data subsetting within the R Markdown environment.

A subset of the data is stored in a Rdata file. In order
to read-in the data correctly, save the Rmd file in a folder with the rest
of your course work. Place the file baseball.Rdata in the same folder. Go to
Session > Set Working Directory > To Source File Location. Now you may run the
below code that will load the data.

```{r}
load("baseball.Rdata")
```

# Lahman data

## Accessing the data

To see all the objects loaded from the baseball data set in this tutorial 
use the function `ls()`. Function `ls()` lists all the objects in the current R
environment.

You may see other objects from previous instances of work in R.

```{r}
ls()
```

To access the content of an object in `R` use the object's name.
Keep in mind that `R` is case sensitive. Thus, we need to type an object's name
exactly as it appears.

Above we see the object `JimRiceBA`. Run the code below to see the contents of
`JimRiceBA`.

```{r}
JimRiceBA
```

*Baseball abbreviations*

Abbreviation | Meaning
---------- | ----------
BA  | Batting Average
HR  | Home Runs
RBI | Runs Batted In

*These are some measures of a batter's success.*

## Descriptive statistics

The names of many functions in `R` are self-explanatory. To compute the minimum,
maximum, and mean for Jim Rice's career batting average we can use the
corresponding functions given below.

```{r}
min(JimRiceBA)
max(JimRiceBA)
mean(JimRiceBA)
```

To find the year in which Jim Rice had his lowest batting average and
the year in which he had his highest batting average,
we can make use of the functions `which.min()` and `which.max()`, respectively.

```{r}
which.min(JimRiceBA)
which.max(JimRiceBA)
```

Let's examine how Rice's batting average changed throughout his career. 
First, we compute year-over-year differences, then view the results. 
Second, we will look at which year he had the largest increase and which year 
he had the largest decrease.

```{r}
# compute differences
JimRiceBA_diffs <- diff(JimRiceBA, lag = 1)
JimRiceBA_diffs

# find years
which.max(JimRiceBA_diffs)
which.min(JimRiceBA_diffs)
```

The `#` symbol was used to add comments. `R` does not execute anything 
following `#`. Use `#` for code documentation to explain to
others why you are doing what you are doing with your code.
Good code documentation is also beneficial for your future self.

## Summary statistics with two variables

Recall that the correlation measures the linear strength between two
quantitative variables. Let's look at the correlation between each pair of
available variables for Jim Rice: batting average, home runs, and RBIs.

```{r}
cor(JimRiceBA, JimRiceHR)
cor(JimRiceBA, JimRiceRBI)
cor(JimRiceHR, JimRiceRBI)
```

To view a simple plot of Rice's home runs versus his RBIs we can use the
`plot()` function.

```{r}
plot(JimRiceHR, JimRiceRBI)
```

## Exercises

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Ted Williams, 1939", out.width = '30%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("tedwilliams.png")
```

Answer parts a-i below. Use a separate code chunk for each part that requires 
code. You will examine data on
[Ted Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Williams).

*To remind yourself of the variable names use the function* `ls()`.

a. Use the `length` function to determine how many seasons Ted Williams played.

b. Which season did Ted Williams have his highest batting average?

c. Plot Williams' batting average over time. To put the years on the x-axis,
   use `names(TedWilliamsBA)`.

d. What was Williams' highest batting average?

e. What was Williams' career mean batting average?

f. What was the correlation between Williams' home runs and RBIs? 
   Was it higher than Jim Rice's correlation?

g. What was the largest absolute change in Williams' RBIs year-over-year?

h. Why does Ted Williams not have any statistics from 1943 - 1945? Was he hurt?

i. Which of the three players (Fisk, Rice, Williams) was most consistent
   year-over-year with regards to the batting average metric? How did
   you define consistency?




# R Markdown

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '30%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("rmarkdown.png")
```

## Exercises

Create the R Markdown file that produced the HTML file 
[ica-01-10-19](http://rpubs.com/shawnsanto/ica-01-10-19). All formatting
should match, but you may replace my name with your own name. Below are some
helpful hints.

1. YAML header should be

```{r eval=FALSE}
---
title: "Console only"
author: " "
date: " "
output: 
  html_document:
    toc: true
    number_sections: true
    toc_float: true
    df_print: paged
---
```

2. In section 3.1 the `longley` data frame is shown, but the code is not.
   You will need to use an appropriate chunk option to get your HTML 
   file to match.

3. To create the final plot use the below code. You will need to install each
   package before you can load them with the `library` function.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(rvg)
library(ggiraph)

longley$tooltip <- paste("GNP: ", longley$GNP, sep = "")

gg_point_1 <- ggplot(longley, 
                     aes(x = Year, y = Employed, tooltip = tooltip)) + 
              geom_point_interactive(size = 4, color = "darkblue") + 
              theme_bw()

ggiraph(ggobj = gg_point_1)
```
